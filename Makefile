# Some more documentation on this command for learning purpose:
# The `grep -E '^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+:' Makefile`, this part finds any lines that matches as commands and its comments.
# For example: "help: ## Shows help command".
#
# The `awk` command has many instructions, so we'll split it:
# - `BEGIN { FS = ":( ##)?" };`, this sets the "file separator" to split the command and the comments.
# - `{ printf "\033[0;31m%-20s \033[0;32m%s\n", $$1, $$2 };`, this will print it as a nice looking help command.
